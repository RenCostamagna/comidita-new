## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account
- Google Maps API key
- Vercel account (for deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/comidita-app.git
   cd comidita-app
   \`\`\`

2. **Install dependencies**
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a \`.env.local\` file in the root directory:
   
   \`\`\`env
   # Supabase Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
   
   # Google Maps (Server-side only for security)
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
   
   # Vercel Blob Storage
   BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_blob_token
   
   # OpenAI (for text enhancement)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   \`\`\`

   **‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note**: The Google Maps API key is kept server-side only to prevent exposure and unauthorized usage. All Maps functionality is handled through secure API routes.

4. **Set up the database**
   
   Run the database setup script in your Supabase SQL editor:
   \`\`\`bash
   # The script is located at scripts/unified-database-setup.sql
   # Copy and paste the content into your Supabase SQL editor
   \`\`\`

5. **Run the development server**
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`

6. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to \`http://localhost:3000\`

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The application uses the following main tables:

- **users**: User profiles and authentication data
- **places**: Restaurant and food place information
- **reviews**: User reviews with ratings and content
- **photos**: Image storage references and metadata
- **achievements**: User achievement tracking
- **notifications**: In-app notification system
- **user_levels**: Gamification and experience tracking

## üåê API Endpoints

### Places
- \`GET /api/places/search\` - Search places with filters
- \`GET /api/places/details\` - Get detailed place information
- \`GET /api/places/photo\` - Fetch place photos

### Photos

## üîí Security Architecture

### API Key Management
- Google Maps API key is stored server-side only
- All Maps operations go through secure API routes
- No sensitive keys are exposed to the client
- Environment variables follow the principle of least privilege

### Authentication & Authorization
- Supabase handles secure user authentication
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies protect data
- Server-side validation for all operations

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. **Connect your repository to Vercel**
